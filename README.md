PROJECT DIRECTORY
        |
        '------> Project status dir (This repo - version controlled w/ Git)
        |
        '------> Conda envs dir (Not version controlled as very data intensive)
        |                     |
        |                     '---> package files (txt docs to pip install from requirements incase incompatibilities occur in my envs)
        |                     |
        |                     '---> conda env (have at least 4 diff ones - tf2,torch,vit,basic. The first 2 cloned from wiay root)
        |                     |
        |                     '---> pkgs (a diversion from `$HOME/.conda/pkgs` as wiay data-limit is strict in wiay.)
        |                      
        '------> Vitamin_b (Most up to date version cloned from Hunter's Git)
        |
        '------> Programming dir (Version controlled from another repo - all my jupyter notebooks for running ML and vit scripts from vscode jupyter server)
