# Structure of /global/computing

## Current

- **DIR** - script logs (_have notes on computing snippets and conda script for now, will add to when i find more about computing stuff_)

- **DIR** - vit issue logs (_markdown script with a template for each vit issue. Each issue has its own sep console output as a .txt_)

## Soon (once vit is running remotely)

- **DIR** - conda_env_dir
  - **SUBDIR** - pkgs (_re-route from \$HOME/.conda/pkgs to prevent data-limit on wiay_)
  - **SUBDIR(S)** - conda envs (_As many as I need - will have alteast 4: Basic, vit, torch, tf and will need to do some conda config stuff to get these into env dirs etc (done it before))_)
