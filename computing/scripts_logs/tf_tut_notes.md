Started the `free_code_camp.org` tensorflow 7hour video tutorial. Will have google colabs on my drive.

## Video notes:

### Module 1 - intro

- NNs is deep-learning comes from the dpeth i.e multiple layers
- `features` = input known parameters (input variables)
- `label` = ouput info from fed-in `features`
- types of learning = `supervised` etc and different algorithms fit inside these learning types, like `regression, classification, clustering` etc.
- `supervised` feed in trainig data (containing both features and labels) whereas `unsupervised` feed in training data only with features (no labels) i.e unsupervised figures out the labels for you

### Module 2 - intro to tf2.0

- [ ] look up gpu and CUDA stuff
- using google colab
- each tensor has a data-type and a shape
- rank/edgree (interchangeable) describes dimesions involved in the tensor 
- a lot of the tf methods are the same as numpy methods like shape etc tf.ones, tf.reshape

### Module 3 - Core algorithms

#### Linear regression

-
