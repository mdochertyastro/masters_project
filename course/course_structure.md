# Summary of assessment sturcture and dates - 8/10/20

1. 0% formative assessment - literature survey and technical essay - **Due 6th November**

   - 5-7 pages
     - 2 page intermin report and 5 page lit review? (good outline for lit rev section of report)
     - actually don't know if I need the 2 page interim bit

2. 40% assessment (**16 credits**) - project conduct - **Determined by Chris**

   - bench hours end **5th March**
   - "It is a literature survey on the research topic and to writing a technical essay (5-7 pages), which will form the basis of the introduction to the final report and which should take ~50 hours."
   - should expect good grade if I keep showing up, engaging with group and taking initiative with the direction of my research! (this last bit is the bit im lacking currently)


3. 20% assessment (**8 credits**) - oral presentation - **Due W/B 8th March**

   - 20 mins total (15mins+questions
   - give plenty of time (full week for slides maybe or work on a little bit everyday for `BEAMER`)
   - Use Sargam's template - more details on slide limit etc TBA
   - Have stopwatch open onscreen
   - Use Douglas' advice and example pres
   - Eve's example pres 
   - mark breakdown:
     - 40% (**3 creds**) delivery and question response (confidence and prep and how well i personally understand topic so can convey to audience in simple terms)
     - 40% (**3 creds**) slides/structure/layout (easy marks - time consuming with beamer)
     - 20% (**2 creds**) actual content of slides (hard marks)

4. 40% assessment (**16 credits**)- project report - **Due 26th March**
   - 20 pages MAX
   - make a nice overleaf template (make Chris a collaborator)
   - Chris wants a final draft submitted to him 2 weeks before deadline which is the Friday of the oral pres week so should really be prepping pres and report simultaneously in late feb (having the lit review section already covered over xmas)
   - overall 1/3rd lit survey, 1/3rd methodology, 1/3rd results (make refs nice and tight)
     - IGR uses Vanvouver refs i think
   - only matric number and project title in report (does matric number include letter?)
   - mark breakdown:
     - 80% (**13 creds**) refs, - (correct choice in setting context) pres+figs -  (captions, professional layout, readable) structure - (all sections in correct order and of balanced length) writing - (concise english with few typos, correct capitisation for abbrevs etc) **NOTE** 80% of all project marks come from how the doc looks, the refs,m fig choice/layout and no typos/ sentence structure. Can literally do all this from significant proofreading alone! dont leave till last minute at all, get the techpaper in on time but slowly gather intro layout 
   - 20% (**3 creds**) technical content (well-informed, good depth/breadth of knowledge - this comes from the intro section where i go wide but then quickly go deep)

## Stuff to alieviate confusion/clear head:

- No poster - this is just 30 credit projects
- need more info on technical essay details (how it fits into final report) - Read Akshara and Federico's and Chirs Duffy's papers maybe (note Chris duffy was 60 cred i think. And Ross's and NIc's group)
- for oral pres. Looks like approx 15mins with 5mins questions BUT will be given updates later on moodle (probs xmas ish), in meantim should prep for 15+5mins and remember how much you CANT fit in when you start so really practise and get the slide number down ~10slides would be ideal - again using `beamer`
