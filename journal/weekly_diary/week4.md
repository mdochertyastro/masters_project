Sorted Zoom Screen sharing has to all be on the right monitor and a wee bar comes up!

Have meeting in 3 hours, want to finish the GWTC1 catalogue then read the re-sampling paper then find a more updated general review like the 2009 paper.
Have read the GWTC1 catalog now to do the resampling one! Then look for updated review and any papers on O3 run(s)
Have read the importance sampling paper and it has nice refs (cross ref them with the GWTC refs then have a look to flesh out my tech paper) Need to start typing up my notes from all these refs before there are too many to keep track of.

NOw going to research how to create gaussian noise
