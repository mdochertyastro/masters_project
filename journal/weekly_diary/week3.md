-

## Morning Session:

Created new Overleaf project and linked it to a new overleaf github repo. Have sepearted the project into 3 for the technical paper, pres and report. Have invited Chris to be a colaborator. For the pres, am experimenting with Sargam's beamer slides and now have a nice theme, have 4 nice pics for title slide and know how to do the fading/updating ToC which is exciting.

For github, researched forking and submodules so now have a global repo (which i will now rname from msci_project_general to msci_project_global) before seinding to Chris.

## Afternoon Session:

Had first igr-data-ml club which was fun and more casual.

## Evening Session

# Tuesday 13th October

## Daily Goals:

- [ ] Write up all meetings properly
- [x] Attempt vit CPU local with 2020 pip
- [ ] Get artciles from week2 meeting into folder
- [ ] Get all articles' BibTeX and make a nice space for them
- [ ] Finish overleaf setup

Time frame:

**Morning** - meeting admin
**Afternoon** - bibtex and overleaf set up
**Evening** - vit coding

## End of Day Thoughts:

Possible repo restructure as not sure if there is benefit of having submodules. Hunter has a single module with his env inside it and still makes pulls/pushes so Im waiting on his response n how he sets up his tree so might be worth just keeping the 3 sep repos.

'PE' as in PE run stands for paramter estimation
Coalsensce is just the merging of two objects in a single massive one

for articles this looks like a good [starting point](https://inspirehep.net/literature/1663048) for its refs etc.

For old school methods look at sampling channel on teams

Got LIGO credentials and now have access to the [IGR gitlab](https://gilsay.physics.gla.ac.uk/gitlab/) and [IGR wiki](https://gilsay.physics.gla.ac.uk/dokuwiki/doku.php?do=index&id=igr-general)

## Daily Goals:

- [ ] ARTICLE FOCUS - read 3 articles

- [ ] continue trying vit stuff
- [ ] create webspaces for publication planning

## End of Day Thoughts:

## Morning Session:

Last night got vit running locally for first time. Now thinking of restructure back to 3 individual repos (general project, vit, overleaf).

Looking at hunter's two commits from last night [commit1](https://github.com/hagabbar/vitamin_b/commit/83f5313165d48a6fde05cc9bfc32766266897042) [commit2](https://github.com/hagabbar/vitamin_b/commit/586df2cf09aaa0b2f9f15c5678559cbcac71f836) he has unspecified package versions (so assuming latest available on pip) Note, cpnest was just updated last night by JOhn to v0.10.1 so this is working now. Wondering wether the whole pip situation works now inseatd of having to run ```pip install --use-feature=2020-resolver``` will see when I clone a new repo locally.

- [ ] Want to remove submodules from golabl and rename them after food.

## Afternoon Session:

About to do a fresh vit source install to see what errors come through after hunter anmd john's new over night commits.
