## End of Day Thoughts:



## Morning Session:

Created new Overleaf project and linked it to a new overleaf github repo. Have sepearted the project into 3 for the technical paper, pres and report. Have invited Chris to be a colaborator. For the pres, am experimenting with Sargam's beamer slides and now have a nice theme, have 4 nice pics for title slide and know how to do the fading/updating ToC which is exciting.

For github, researched forking and submodules so now have a global repo (which i will now rname from msci_project_general to msci_project_global) before seinding to Chris.
