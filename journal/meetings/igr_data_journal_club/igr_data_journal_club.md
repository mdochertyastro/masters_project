# Meeting 1 - 20th October 

## Overview

**Speaker**: Daniel
**Paper**: [Are merging black holes born from stellar collapse or previous mergers? (2007)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06223)

## Notes

- look up what 'model selection' is, seems to be coming up
- the idea is that BBH pair is observed but each each BH is so massive that they could be themselves each consequences of a previous merger (i think thats the gist of the paper)
- from 2017 so looking at GW150914
- there is an updated version as of May 2020
